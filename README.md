# Predicting Climate Change Using Machine Learning at ClimateWins

<b><span style='color:#154360'>The next weather station we look at is München/Munich and for the year 2001
    Climate Wins is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world. It’s been sorting through hurricane predictions from <a href='https://www.noaa.gov/'>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</a> in the U.S., typhoon data from <a href='https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/indexe.html'>The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)</a> in Japan, world temperatures, and a great deal of other data. However, it’s hard to grasp how everything is changing in the world at once. This is where machine learning comes in!</span></b>

## Getting Started

For this project, we are interested in identifying the best resources for predicting climate changes where people live. We have chosen to use both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
