# Predicting Climate Change Using Machine Learning at ClimateWins

<span style='color:#154360'>
Climate Wins is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world. It’s been sorting through hurricane predictions from <a href='https://www.noaa.gov/'>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</a> in the U.S., typhoon data from <a href='https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/indexe.html'>The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)</a> in Japan, world temperatures, and a great deal of other data. However, it’s hard to grasp how everything is changing in the world at once. This is where machine learning comes in!</span>

### Getting Started

For this project, we are interested in identifying the best resources for predicting climate changes where people live. We have chosen to use both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

### Models

We have chosen one supervised learning model and two unsupervised models:
<ul><li>K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)</li><li>Decision Tree</li><li>Artificial Neural Network</li></ul>

### Data

<ul><li>The data is obtained from the <a href='https://www.ecad.eu/'>European Climate Assessment & Data Set project</a></li>
<li>The <a href='https://s3.amazonaws.com/coach-courses-us/public/courses/da-spec-ml/Scripts/A1/Dataset-weather-prediction-dataset-processed.csv'>dataset</a> consists of weather observations from 18 European weather stations from the late 1800s to 2022.</li>
<li>Recordings exist for almost every day with values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and more.</li></ul>

### Using ML in Weather Data

Machine learning (ML) algorithms are a set of techniques that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for a specific task. ML can be highly beneficial for analysing and predicting weather patterns. This can include forecasting temperatures, humidity, wind speed, rainfall etc. They can also be used to detect unusual events or patterns such as heatwaves or unseasonal rains.
For this project, we are using three ML algorithms:                                                                                                            
<ul><li><i>k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)</i> - is a simple, versatile, and widely-used machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a supervised learning algorithm, meaning it relies on labelled training data to learn and make predictions.</li>
<li><i>Decision Tree</i> - also used for classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features, making it highly interpretable and effective for a range of practical applications.</li>
<li><i>Artificial Neural Network</i> - is used for a wide range of machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, and many more complex problems like image recognition, natural language processing, and time-series forecasting.</li></ul>
